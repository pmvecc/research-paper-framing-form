# Research Paper Framing Form

A simple online form to help researchers structure their journal article ideas before drafting. 

This tool helps clarify the title, thesis, contribution, data, and intended audience, then converts the answers as a markdown file for further refinement.

The user may provide this information to a chosen LLM to generate draft sections and journal ideas, or use the results to manually iterate their ideas.
