# Research Paper Framing Form

A simple online form to help researchers structure their journal article ideas before drafting. 

This tool helps clarify the title, thesis, contribution, data, and intended audience, then converts the answers as a markdown file for further refinement.

## Purpose

- Generate early abstracts or outlines
- Identify the right journals for submission
- Clarify conceptual and practical impact of your work
